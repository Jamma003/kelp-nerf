Changes dried kelp blocks so they only smelt 8 items (same as coal) instead of the vanilla 20.

Automated kelp farming is kind of OP and I wanted coal to remain important.

I also made a mod called Activated Coal that allows you to mix coal and redstone to smelt 16 items per coal. It goes well with this one.
